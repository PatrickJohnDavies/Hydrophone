Goals:
    Qualitateviely evaluate the design
    Hear propeller noise
    Hopefully hear a Dolphin squeek

Site:
    Located the hydrohphones 25 ft of the Bear Cut bridge in Miami. Site was chosen because it was near a popular boat channel.

Setup:
    The left and right hyrdrophone were suspended in the water column by the "stand". Approxitmately 30" apart.
    They plugged into the amplifier and the resulting sound was listened to through headphones.

Result:
    Even though the waves were relatively calm there was a predominant high frequency rustling noise. 
    With the gain cranked to about 3/4 it was possible to hear propeller noise at 400 to 500 meters from accelerating recreational motor boats. 
    Ambient noise at this level was almost overwhelming though. Spectral analysis would have been nice to see if analog filtering would be effective.
    Idling motor boats were not immeditaley detectable.
    Sound bearing determination with the stereo hydrophones was not immeditaley apparent.
    Recording with an iphone dongle was not working unfortunately.
